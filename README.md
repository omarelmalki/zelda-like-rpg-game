#### *how to battle the Dark Lord*:

The Dark Lord, situated in front of the castle, is immune to all physical and fire type attacks, he is however vulnerable to magic type attacks.
To beat him, the staff must be acquired from the temple that is located to the right of the area "Route", to access this area, the orb must be 
activated by shooting it with a bow. 

If you lose all your hp during battle, you won't be able to move but simply press "R" to resume the game and recover all your hp.

In dark mode (skeleton skin), you cannot take damage, but cannot damage the enemies,
which means you need to switch back to Idle (command "D") mode after taking the portal to RouteChateau, and then use the staff acquired.

Dark Lord's powers:

- spawning Flame Skull monsters
- spawning Fire Spells
- teleporting away once the player has gotten too close

#### *Accessing the temple and obtaining the magical staff*:

As mentioned above, the orb must me activated by the means of acquiring a bow (and arrows as well, or else the bow would be rendered useless),
and shooting it, a bridge will the magically appear allowing the player to traverse it to access "RouteTemple", where a temple would be located.
Inside should be the staff, a chest containing an APE_FLOWER that allows the player to transform into the dark state (a state where the monsters do 
not recognize him, but cannot attack once in this state), and a portal that leads to the area "RouteChateau" where the Dark Lord is located.

#### *Obtaining coins*:

Coins are a guaranteed Log Monster drop, and are sometimes randomly dropped once grass has been cut or bombed.

#### *Acquiring a bow and some arrows*:

Buy them in the shop in the Village Arrows cost 5 and bows 10, you can also buy bombs for 15. 

#### *End game*:

Once the Dark Lord is beaten, he will drop a key allowing access to the Castle, thus ending the game and ruining his evil plan. 

Once in Chateau, you will see a portal that takes you back home to Ferme (you need to go dark mode to use it),
as well as a chest containing a MAX_POTION that you can use to restore all your HP.
